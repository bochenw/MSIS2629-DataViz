## Project Statment

**Deceptive Visualization:** *“a graphical depiction of information, designed with or without an intent to deceive, that may create a belief about the message and/or its components, which varies from the actual message.”*


## Finding 1

The original graph stated that gun homicides have declined over the past couple decades, especially since 1993, it appeared a great and sudden drop, but if we start looking this graph

## Data Wrangling

### [Jupyter Notebook Link](https://github.com/gleamingMushroom/MSIS2629-DataViz/blob/master/Deceptive%20Data%20Product%20Data%20Wrangling.ipynb)

Data of finding 1 & 2 are downloaded from CDC Multiple Cause of Death Data: https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd.html.
The data represented firearm caused death in each state each year, from 1999 to 2016.
