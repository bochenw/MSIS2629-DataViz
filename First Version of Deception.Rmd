## Project Statment

**Deceptive Visualization:** *“a graphical depiction of information, designed with or without an intent to deceive, that may create a belief about the message and/or its components, which varies from the actual message.”*

This Project is a deceptive visualization data product inspired by an article of Vox -- [America’s unique gun violence problem, explained in 17 maps and charts](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts). It is propose to sharpen the skills in detecting intentional and unintentional distortions to the data.

Let's see the following comparisons of the original graph versus the decptive ones:

## Finding 1 - Have gun homicides really declined in the US over the past few years?

The original graph stated that gun homicides have declined over the past couple decades, we can see from the original graph that it did appeare a great and sudden drop, especially since 1993, the death rate of homicides decreased and tended to be stable.

But if our data start from 1999, the meaning could be completely different. The deceptive graph took the same dataset, but different time period, and also the axis start point was manipulated, so the trend seems fluctuated remarkably. It can be seen that the death rate of homicides is tumultuous, goes up and down, with a decline around 2007 - 2011, and goes up from 2014 - 2016, eventually exceed the start year number.

## Finding 2 - Most gun deaths are suicides?

The original graph shows majority of gun-related deaths in the US are suicides. We can see that line of suicides is much higher than homicides and still on a rising trend.

But if we change the graph to a different pattern, it could be visually tricked. The deceptive graph does not oppose the conclusion of *"greater access to guns dramatically increases the risk of suicide"*, but with the distorted area size and truncated y-axis, the visual effects are different. The deceptive graph intentionally leave an impression of homecide number is higher than suicide.

## Finding 3 - States with more guns have more gun deaths?

The original graph believes *“within the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide."*

Using the same data from a study in Injury Prevention and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, if we reverse the axis orientation, it could be visually deceptive. To compare with the original one, the deceptive graph shows an opposite trend line. As it change the way people's normal understanding of axis' representation, it could be visually misleading to "More gun ownership, lower death rate".

## Finding 4 - Is it true that the states with the most guns report the most suicides?

Using the data of reported suicides between 2001 and 2005 in states with the highest and lowest rates of gun ownership, we can see the significant contrast from the original graph. But if we only use the data of high rate gun ownership states and differentiate them with gender, the result does not support the conclusion of *"More guns, more suicides".* 

In the deceptive graph, for male, it is true that firearm suicide is higher than non-firearm suiciede, but for female, firearm suicide and non-firearm suiciede is almost the same, actually, the non-firearm suiciede bar is higher. So we can only say that: *"For Male, More guns lead to more suicides".*

## Data Wrangling

### [Jupyter Notebook Link](https://github.com/gleamingMushroom/MSIS2629-DataViz/blob/master/Deceptive%20Data%20Product%20Data%20Wrangling.ipynb)

Data of finding 1 & 2 are downloaded from CDC Multiple Cause of Death Data: https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd.html.
The data represented firearm caused death in each state each year, from 1999 to 2016. 

## Road-map

In the future improvement, instead of only focus on the US, it would be better to generate more data from different countries. As only with more comparisons of different countries will make the unique problems in the US more standout.
