## Project Statment

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Data Wrangling

### [Jupyter Notebook Link](https://github.com/gleamingMushroom/MSIS2629-DataViz/blob/master/Deceptive%20Data%20Product%20Data%20Wrangling.ipynb)

Data of finding 1 & 2 are downloaded from CDC Multiple Cause of Death Data: https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd.html.
The data represented firearm caused death in each state each year, from 1999 to 2016.
